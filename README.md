### Code Formatting

-   **Eslint**

The project uses [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) to identify errors in the code and ensure a minimum level of code quality.

Run the linter:

```sh
npm run lint
```

_After running this command, you need to fix the detected errors (issues) and rerun it to ensure everything is clean_ ðŸ˜‰

-   **Prettier**

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) formats the code according to the common standards configured, ensuring that the entire team or anyone working on the project follows the same source code format.

Check for improperly formatted code:

```sh
npm run check-format
```

Format the code:

```sh
npm run format
```

### Commitlint

[Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/guides/getting-started.html) is a module that allows configuring commit message patterns and formats to ensure that commit messages are clear, facilitating better collaboration and adherence to recommended standards for writing good commit messages, as suggested by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

A valid commit message consists of three parts: **the header**, **the body**, and **the footer**.

```sh
git commit -m "build(core): init project"
```

### Git Hooks (Husky)

Git Hooks allow you to run custom scripts when certain important actions occur.

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) enables you to configure and automate certain actions before every commit, push, etc.

For example, in our project, we have configured it to run eslint and prettier to format the code before each commit.
